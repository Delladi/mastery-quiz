# Write a program that groups people based on their favourite
# things. In should:
# * Ask the user to input a category - `sport` or `fruit`.
# * Put the `people` into groups where each group has people who share
#   the same favourite thing.
# * Print out the names of the people in each group.  Before each
#   group, it should say which favourite thing the people in the group
#   share.
#
# * Example output:
#   ```
#   Enter category to group people by
#   sport
#   squash
#   Mary
#   Lauren
#   Govind
#   weightlifting
#   Isla
#   Awad
#   cycling
#   Sam
#   Will
#   ```
#
# Note: You can assume that, when asked for a category, the user will
# only enter either `sport` or `fruit`.
